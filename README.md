# Remove-File-Via-Python-

This Python script adds a fun twist by potentially deleting itself as a prank. It generates a random number between 1 and 6, and if the number is 6, it attempts to delete the script file. However, it includes safeguards to handle potential errors, such as the file not being found. This script is intended for entertainment purposes only and should not be used to harm others
